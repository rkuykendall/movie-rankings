# Personal Top 250

This is not an exact list, but it gets closer every time I work on it. This
Top 250 is generated algorithmically from the hand-ranked-lists in the
`rankings` folder. These are combined to create a master list using the [ELO
rating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system).

### Script usage:
- `python cli.py` Print rankings
- `python cli.py new` Print list of movies to be ranked
- `python cli.py best` Print list of high-ranking movies to be ranked
- `python cli.py health` Print how well-defined your movie ranking is
